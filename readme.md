# Beyond all Reason (BAR) RFCs

Many changes both in terms of bugs but also balance can often be addressed via Github issues or threads within the relevant discord channel.

Some changes are significantly more substantial and these belong as RFCs where they can be discussed and decided upon by the relevant BAR team member(s).

The RFC (request for comments) process is intended to provide a documented and consistent for new features or larger changes to become part of the game.
